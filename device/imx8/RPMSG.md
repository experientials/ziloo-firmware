2.8 Remote Processor Messaging

2.8.1 Introduction

With the newest multicore architecture designed by using the Arm CortexÂ®-A series processors and the ArmCortex-M series processors, industrial applications can achieve greater power efficiency for a reduced carbon footprint. This reduces power consumption without performance deterioration.
A homogeneous SoC would traditionally run a single operating system (OS) that controls all the memory. The OS or a hypervisor would handle task management among available cores to maximize system utilization. Such a system is called Symmetric MultiProcessing (SMP).
A heterogeneous multicore chip where different processing cores running different instruction sets and different OSs. Each processing core handles a specific task as required. Such a system is called Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP). To understand the distinction between the SMP and AMP systems, it is possible for a homogeneous multicore SoC to be an AMP system but a heterogeneous multicore SoC cannot be an SMP system.
A multicore architecture brings new challenges to the system design, because the software must be rewritten to distribute tasks across the available cores. In addition, all the peripheral resources need to be properly allocated to avoid resource contention and achieve efficient sharing of the data spaces between the cores. A multicore SoC also needs mechanisms for reliable communication and synchronization among tasks running on different processing cores.
RPMsg is a virtio-based messaging bus, which allows kernel drivers to communicate with remote processors available on the system. In turn, drivers could then expose appropriate user space interfaces if needed. Every RPMsg device is a communication channel with a remote processor (so the RPMsg devices are called channels). Channels are identified by a textual name and have a local ("source") RPMsg address, and remote ("destination") RPMsg address. For more information, see www.kernel.org/doc/ Documentation/rpmsg.txt.
As shown in the following figure, the messages pass between endpoints through bidirectional connection-less communication channels.
